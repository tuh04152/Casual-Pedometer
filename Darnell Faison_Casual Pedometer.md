# Casual Pedometer

This project is an Android phone application that records the user's movements to help them with walking exercise. The application will record how long a walk takes,
how many steps the user walked, how many calories they burned on their walk and record their route. In addition, this app will allow for Spotify playlist integration and 
playback inside the application itself, allowing the app to also function as a music player.

This project will involve using Github to track the evolution of this app from a simple GPS tracker to a fully-featued useful application. The addition of Spotify integration
is a unique feature that I have not seen before and is of personal interest to me. Finally, I know how to test, run and publish Android applications, which will make this project
easier to develop. The project will be using the GPSWithMaps application found here on Github as a base.

My contribution to this project is to add the functinolity described above for the exercise portion. Additionally, I will personally create the Spotify integration by using
the beta Spotify SDK. Finally, I will change the UI from only displaying a GPS map with Location Updates to also include the music playlist and controls on the screen;
the map will be called by the user manually, instead of always being present.

To run and test this project, one will need *Android Studio* with an emulated Android device of SDK 29 or later. Instructions on how to do so, can be found online if this is unclear.
